// Identity is decoupled from content: an entry's `id` is a filename-derived
// slug for built-ins and a minted UUID for user uploads, while `hash` is a
// content attribute (non-unique) used only for dedup detection and
// content-addressed blob sharing. Metadata is two-tier: `derived` is
// recomputed from the bytes (index/cache), `user` is the overridable layer
// primed from the known-image registry.
